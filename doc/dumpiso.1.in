.SH NAME
dumpiso \- dump IEEE 1394 isochronous channel packets
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dumpiso
[ \fIoptions\fR ] [ \fIFILE\fR ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
dumpiso listens on a selected range of channels and dumps all received
packets into the file \fIFILE\fR or, if not given, to standard output.
While dumping, the current number of received packets is written to
standard error and updated with every packet.
.PP
It uses a simple file format for the dumps which is described in
\fBisodump\fR(5).  The dumped packets can be sent out again with
\fBsendiso\fR(1).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -c\fR,\fB --channels=\fICHANNELS
Sets the channels to listen on.  \fICHANNELS\fR can be either a single
number, in which case this is the only channel to listen on, or a
range of channels in the form X-Y.  Channel numbers can range from 0
to 63.  You can give this option multiple times, new channels are
added to the list of already set channels.  Defaults to all channels.
.TP
.B -p\fR,\fB --port=\fIPORT
Choose port \fIPORT\fR for receiving.  A port is a 1394 card or chip
and represents one connected bus, therefore this is only relevant when
you have multiple of these.  Defaults to 0.
.TP
.B -h\fR,\fB --help
Show help text and exit.
.SH BUGS
None known.
