.TH sendiso 1 "libraw1394 @VERSION@" "" "Linux IEEE 1394"
.SH NAME
sendiso \- send IEEE 1394 isochronous packets from dump file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sendiso
[ \fIoptions\fR ] \fIFILE\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
sendiso takes the dump file \fIFILE\fR as generated by
\fBdumpiso\fR(1), extracts the packets and sends them as they were
received (in the same order, with the same channel numbers) as fast as
possible - timing of the original dump is not preserved.
.PP
This program does not allocate any isochronous resources but just
starts sending.  It should not be used in live environments where it
might interfere with properly set up isochronous transmissions, it is
a debug and performance benchmarking tool.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -l\fR,\fB --loop=\fICOUNT
Send dump file \fICOUNT\fR times.  Defaults to 1.
.TP
.B -i\fR,\fB --infinite
Send dump file in an endless loop.
.TP
.B -s\fR,\fB --speed=\fISPEED
Send packets at speed \fISPEED\fR, which can be given as 100, 200 and
400 (in Mbit/s) or abbreviated as 1, 2 and 4.  Defaults to 100.
.TP
.B -p\fR,\fB --port=\fIPORT
Choose port \fIPORT\fR for sending.  A port is a 1394 card or chip and
represents one connected bus, therefore this is only relevant when you
have multiple of these.  Defaults to 0.
.TP
.B -h\fR,\fB --help
Show help text and exit.
.SH BUGS
None known.
