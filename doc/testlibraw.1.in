.SH NAME
testlibraw \- run basic functionality tests on libraw1394
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B testlibraw
.SH DESCRIPTION
testlibraw attaches to the Linux IEEE 1394 subsystem through libraw1394 and
tries to read data from all connected nodes.  It therefore acts as a check that:
.IP *
libraw1394 is installed correctly
.IP *
the IEEE 1394 subsystem is loaded in the kernel and of a supported version
.IP *
libraw1394 and kernel side raw1394 can communicate
.IP *
connected nodes can be reached and do respond.
.PP
The read transactions are of a form that all powered up nodes conforming to the
IEEE 1394 standard have to be able to respond to.
.PP
The source of this program also acts as a demonstration of libraw1394
programming, including initialization, transactions and the event loop.
.SH EXAMPLE RUN
FIXME: insert example here
